# Artillery Tailwind

This is a temporary repo to host a static build of our latest Tailwind build. This is only to be used anywhere you may require a static build for one off or standalone projects. Current usage is for the HTML Report for example.

To generate a new build simply run:

```
npm run output
```

Once you've done this, you can require the raw build file from GitHub.
